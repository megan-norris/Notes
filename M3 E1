# MODULE 3 EXCERCISE 1

When going through the Recovered Histories website, what makes me believe it might be a trustworthy provider of historical texts is that it does make reference to some third parties that provided the information, and it *DOES* outline everything it intends to get by with the website and all the sorts of things we might encounter and where they got the bulk of their information from.

However what makes me believe it might *NOT* be a trustworthy provider, I guess is a) my general cynicism to anything reproduced on another source without me being able to physical manhandle the evidence myself, and b) the overall layout of the website. Maybe I'm being picky towards the set-up, and did end up figuring out how to properly use the thing, but I just thought it was sloppy coding to use, and irritating. I thought the world part was that the text was hard to read. It just took away whatever impression I might have had for the overall content on the page. That may not be a substantial reason to no believe in its content, but I definitely wasn't a fan.

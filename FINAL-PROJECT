<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blood Diamonds</span></em></h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Still an Issue - Even Though Mostly Forgotten</h4>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Introduction</span></strong></em></h2>
The notion that there could be anything dirty behind such a beautiful gem is fairly hard to fathom for a lot of people. Think of when you want to be proposed to (or propose to someone), when you think of what you want most - people typically answer: <em>diamonds.</em> Most women (trying not to over-generalize here) know what they want the ring to look like, the carat, most even go so far to provide a picture to their significant others. It's a symbol of eternal love. It's a symbol of unity. It's a symbol that there is so much more to come in your life.

Most don't end up acknowledging the well-known fact just how that diamond came to be in its tiny format. We all know how Leonard DiCaprio is, but when I was 16 there was a movie of his that came out and truly resonated with me. It prompted my general interest in activism, later leading me to the heinous conditions of Sudan and the sort. For all purposes, what caught my eye (ten years ago this year actually), was the horrendous conditions surrounding something I used to find so beautiful and pure. Call it naivety, but I truly couldn't understand just how little people thought of one another, that it was okay to kill others for the sake of a gem. Blood Diamond was one of those films that kept you on your toes, you weren't entirely fond of all the characters, but you were fond about the story. You were mesmerized by the line: <em>"based on a true story,"</em> since that's what REALLY gets people intrigued.

However, it's just a movie, right? It must be based on things that don't happen anymore, right? It's a part of history, that's why one of the tags for the movie (after drama and everything else) is <em>history</em>. The movie came out - that must mean the end for such horrendous living/working conditions! That's not the case. That's the audiences' naivety shining through. We can't help it though - we're captivated temporarily for two to three hours, some of us do a quick google search, try to see what we might be able to do from preventing these atrocities from continuing, and then we move on when we think we really can't do all that much.

Sixteen-year-old me saw it that way. I remember the first time I brought up wanting to research topics that observed how little people cared for human right's in South Africa. I remember viewing images you shouldn't normally view as a teenager. I remember hopelessly wishing I could be there to lend a helping hand - build a giant wall that would prevent anyone from coming in and hurting <em>kids</em> that were stuck in those living conditions. My captivation slowly came to an end when I realized I needed to focus on my studies just so I'd be able to reach a career where I could help others. I needed to focus on the present, in my first-world country, in the comfort of my bed, where I knew I had clean clothes, a roof over my head, and a loving family to take care of all the needs I could imagine.

Slowly, but surely, I forgot about Blood Diamonds and what that word even meant, as my interest waned, and people stopped talking about it.

Yet, as <a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">Time</a> so eloquently describes, it's a still a prominent issue. It didn't just disappear, there was a lot of attention around Blood Diamonds after the movie came out, but just as quickly as it came about, interest disappeared.

That hasn't prevented teenagers from living through the horror they see every day though - as we progress through <a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">Time's</a> article, it talks about the state of Congo, and diamonds are currency. You mine, you dine (as terrible as that sounds). These kids, who do not get to spend a day in school learning the same things you and I are, are in mines scraping away, to pay for things to help their family survive. Whether it's medication for a sick family member, providing food for as many as they could, or maybe one day hoping to escape the life they were born into.
<blockquote>"An $81.4 billion-a-year industry that links the mines of Africa, home to 65% of the world’s diamonds, with the sparkling salesrooms of high-end jewelry retailers around the world. It is an industry that was supposed to be cleaned up, after the turn-of-the-millennium­ notoriety surrounding so-called blood or conflict ­diamonds—precious stones mined in African war zones, often by forced labor, and used to fund armed rebel movements." <a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">- Aryn Baker</a></blockquote>
Many people think to themselves: <em>"Yeah, but, this is hardly my problem."</em> On a small scale, it doesn't affect you in the slightest. You go about your day like any other. On a larger scale, it's a corrupt industry with branches so filthy built around a jungle of security and forgery. It employs approximately 10 million people worldwide. I can't think of any other corrupt organization that has that many people "allegedly" involved with it. The worst part about it is how you can't maintain 10 million people under one roof, it's on such a national scale, there are too many high-valued, high-class, famous, infamous, etc., people attached to the industry you couldn't touch it with a ten foot poll.

It still doesn't mean you ignore it. It would be your problem if you were born within the worst parts of the industry.
<blockquote>"It’s a scandal,” says Zacharie Mamba, head of Tshikapa’s mining division. “We have so much wealth, yet we stay so poor. I can understand why you Americans say you don’t want to buy our diamonds. Instead of blessings, our diamonds bring us nothing but misfortune."</blockquote>
So, the question from this is (not just one, that would be too easy!):
<ol>
	<li>How do we continue to keep the general population informed?</li>
	<li>How do we make this a public issue, not just a privatized one?</li>
	<li>How do we ensure that the interest doesn't disappear?</li>
	<li>How can we protect people's rights?</li>
	<li>Where do we find the correct information?</li>
</ol>
This is meant to give a brief analysis of the Blood Diamond culture, as it still survives today, and how we can continue to keep ourselves informed. It does not necessarily go into exactly what we need to do, but as interested historians, it outlets why we should think these issues are important.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Brief Timeline</em></span></strong></h2>
The Diamond industry didn't come to exist as a problem to human rights in 2006, the deplorable nature of how they treat their "employees" and competition, has been around for centuries. For this timeline to function we must look at a number of points, we'll begin from the 18th century in Sierra Leone:
<ul>
	<li>1808 - Sierra Leone was annexed as a British Colony, with complete control given to the British Crown</li>
	<li>1867 - Africa's diamond industry dates back to here, where diamonds were discovered near Kimberley, South Africa</li>
	<li>Ex-Slaves in Leone were not given any say in government matters, which evidently caused distress</li>
	<li>African Kings and their people now had to take orders from the European District Commissioner - who were allowed to allocate land, which gave room for many to take advantage of this biased system for their own gain</li>
	<li>1930 - The first diamond was found in Sierra Leone, creating a new lucrative opportunity for production</li>
	<li>1968 - Siaka Stevens became primer minister and viewed the diamond industry as a perfect opportunity to promote illicit mining operations (including criminal activities)</li>
	<li>1991 - Civil War claimed 50,000 lives and displaced over one million people, it is <a href="https://history105.libraries.wsu.edu/fall2014/2014/08/30/african-blood-diamonds/">estimated</a> that 4% of rough diamonds in the world's supply are conflict diamonds</li>
	<li>2002 - In Angola, end of a 27 year civil war that killed 1.5 million people, and displaced 4 million, the diamond industry was behind a large funding of the rebel group, which leads to the original use of the term <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15842522/ns/world_news/t/diamonds-journey-beginning/" target="_blank">"blood diamonds"</a></li>
	<li>2003 - 2005 - Sierra Leone looks to curb a positive image on their industry, joining the <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/" target="_blank">"Kimberley Process"</a> and exported <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15842522/ns/world_news/t/diamonds-journey-beginning/">$142 million worth of diamonds</a></li>
	<li>
<blockquote>2006 - "Rapper Kanye West’s 2006 Grammy Award-winning song “Diamonds from Sierra Leone” and the 2006 Leonardo DiCaprio movie “Blood Diamond” have drawn attention to the appalling conditions of the war, but the diamond industry is quick to emphasize that international regulations are now in place to make conflict diamonds a thing of the past." <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15842522/ns/world_news/t/diamonds-journey-beginning/" target="_blank">- Petra Cahill</a></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population Interest Timeline</span></strong></em></h2>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-144" src="https://megannorrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/interestovertimegoogle.png" alt="interestovertimegoogle" width="868" height="344" />

The movie that starts Leonardo DiCaprio came out at the end of 2006, which explains the influx of the Google Search "Blood Diamond". As you can see form the data above, the general interest dissipates, but never truly disappears, there are mild fluctuations in interests as the year goes on, but for sake of argument - as a population we stop caring.

However, it is a SIGNIFICANT change in interest from when the movie comes out versus on the history from before. The movie (and really anything on a viral level) truly changes our interest in diamonds. It wouldn't matter if you've never heard of the diamond conflict before, or even seen Leonardo DiCaprio's movie - someone has, or someone has told someone about it, and on a large scale the movie has had its influence.

I've had numerous discussions with friends and family who are recently engaged, or hope to be, and <em>desperately hope</em> that their significant other will steer away from diamonds. I too, hope my partner will never pick diamonds, but he doesn't share the same keen interest in this like I do. I'll probably inform him of my disdain for the culture of surrounding diamonds, and he would not bat an eye. Which is fine, a lot of people who are not interested in the devastating effects of a violent regime/industry, just don't care.
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img class=" size-full wp-image-145 aligncenter" src="https://megannorrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/interestovertimeregional.png" alt="interestovertimeregional" width="855" height="426" />
<a href="https://www.google.ca/trends/explore#q=blood%20diamond&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4" target="_blank">Google Data Link</a></h6>
The fascinating portion of the google interest search was the regional interest. I found Bangladesh and Pakistan to be of interest as they scored higher on this than Canada or even the USA that doesn't even make it into the top 7. I find it equally interesting that South America and large portions of Africa, had no regional interest in something that impacts them so greatly. Obviously this could be as a result of not having the means to do a Google search (for obvious reasons).

The most interesting part of this search is the fact that we ARE interested, in the moment, when it is being pushed in our faces to acknowledge a problem, but we are quick to dismiss it as something we cannot change. From a historical stand point, the fact that a movie can have such a large impact on the world is evidence enough that with how technology is evolving. We should find other outlets to push the knowledge out there, to ensure that everyone, everywhere is gaining the same understanding we are, and that there should be more people pressed to find a sense of activism in their hearts.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Where Are We Headed?</em></strong></span></h2>
The <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/" target="_blank">Kimberley Process</a> is where the world has headed, as an agreement that things need to change in Africa. As their mission statement states on the front page:
<blockquote>"The Kimberley Process (KP) is a joint governments, industry and civil society initiative to stem the flow of conflict diamonds – rough diamonds used by rebel movements to finance wars against legitimate governments."</blockquote>
It's hard to grasp what that really all means, we have a large number of people who identify at two sides when we read things like this. Those who believe it's just a front, words that are put on for show when they have the situation entirely out of control. Then there's those who put enough faith in a system, that will hopefully work.

However, we need to continue our efforts in recognizing it's still a problem. On a historical level, so many countries still exhibit to be in complete violation of people's human rights. You have teenagers continuing to work in mines because they need to provide, you have armed children fighting in rebel battles, or against rebels. We live in a world where the largest, highest-grossing commodity begins from the hands of children.
<blockquote>"The Kimberley Process was hailed as a major step toward ending diamond-­fueled conflict. Ian Smillie, one of the early architects of the process and an authority on conflict diamonds, estimates that only 5% to 10% of the world’s diamonds are traded illegally now compared with 25% before 2003, a huge boon for producing nations that have a better chance at earning an income off their natural resources." <a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">- Aryn Baker</a></blockquote>
As this info-graph portrays:
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img class=" size-full wp-image-148 aligncenter" src="https://megannorrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/blood-diamond1.png" alt="blood-diamond1" width="560" height="1502" />

The Kimberley Process is a step forward in the right direction, but all the speed an momentum that was gained from the movie in 2006 has let off steam. We need to continue to spread our knowledge, and with technology these days it should be easy. Every day we are bombarded and flooded with articles of here and there, this travesty and that one, this is one that we tread lightly around despite it being such a large part of our economy. We cannot be stagnant in our regards to this area, no matter how lucrative and essentials, we must look for alternatives.

[gallery ids="150,151,153,154" type="rectangular"]
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2010/jul/23/world-diamond-trade-map" target="_blank">Production Maps Provided by the Guardian</a></h6>
We have a general, founded knowledge about where the present illegal activities ranches from in Africa, where many other problems also originate from. The Kimberley Process is a beginning to a larger scale momentum of preventing more illegal activities, but where do we go from here? We need to continue to spread this history. We can't stand still in general conversation, we should be promoting the fact that the industry is corrupt. We need to acknowledge that fact change does not stop when a movie ends.

We need to look at human rights, we need to ensure that proper labor practices are put in place and that human right offenses are taken seriously and discredit the industry leaders in charge of those areas.
<blockquote>"Even in some cases where the Kimberley Process has implemented a ban—as in the Central African Republic (CAR), where diamonds have helped fund a genocidal war that has killed thousands since 2013—conflict­ diamonds are still leaking out. A U.N. panel of experts estimates that 140,000 carats of ­diamonds—with a retail value of $24 ­million—have been smuggled out of the country since it was suspended in May 2013." <a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">- Aryn Baker</a></blockquote>
In the number of articles I read, there is a theme amongst them, as what I found when I copy and pasted about ten articles into Voyant to get a result, I was met with these:

[gallery ids="156,157,158" type="rectangular"]

Diamonds, war, conflict, trade - these are all words that we don't want to be combined. There has been a stringent effort for change, but it's a lot of talk. They want to expand the Kimberley Process to include different definitions of where things should be changed, but that becomes difficult when illegal activity is still occurring. Very little progress has actually been achieved, probably because of how many other things are actually happening in the world. It's not the only thing occurring that is a Human Right's atrocity, similar to wanting different efforts on coffee beans, the big company's acknowledge the existence of a problem, like Tiffany's and Co., but this is the extent of their efforts:
<blockquote>"Tiffany &amp; Co., Signet and De Beers’ Forevermark brand have instituted strict sourcing policies for their diamonds that address many of these concerns. In New York next March, jewelry-­industry executives from around the world will meet for an unprecedented 2½-day conference on responsible sourcing in an attempt to hammer out an industry-wide process as transparent as the one that brings fair-trade coffee to Starbucks." <a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">- Aryn Baker</a></blockquote>
It's a small step in the right direction, but it loses steam very quickly. The people that might have been irritated by it are appeased, but the small group of people that truly care on a larger scale are not impacted by some complacent gestures. These companies don't outwardly portray disgust in how violent and volatile the industry is, or make promises and action plans to work with activist groups to go in and solve the problem of rebels and illegal transfer of blood/conflict diamonds, because at the end of the day they will still get in their hands if the rebels allow them to be. These companies have enough sources for funds to be able to make change, but they do press releases instead to say: <em>this or that</em> to calm people down without solving the real problem.

It's already well known for the children employees, that this countries would greatly decline in their economies if the diamond industry was cut off. No one is saying that should happen, but the way it operates should be changed. The fact children work in mines doesn't skim the surface of things that should not be occurring in an industry like this. We cannot stop from talking to people about something like this.

The moment we become complacent about any topic in history, is typically the moment we repeat it. So much turmoil rots through Africa every second of every day, as it has for centuries. There is something new that comes up, whether it's lack of food, lack of water, AIDS, ebola, everything combined, we know there are problems, but we need to continue to spread the word.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></span></h2>
<a title="Blood_Diamonds_of_the_Digital_Age_Coltan" href="https://megannorrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/blood_diamonds_of_the_digital_age_coltan.pdf">Blood</a> Diamonds, or as they are now romanticized in being called "Conflict" Diamonds, are a problem that hasn't disappeared just because a movie came out ten years ago. History does not stop because a movie brought a different perspective. We need to continue to build up speed and talk about resolutions for a large scale problem that effects the most lucrative business in the whole world.
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-161" src="https://megannorrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/troublewdiamonds.png" alt="troublewdiamonds" width="1257" height="620" />
<a href="http://time.com/blood-diamonds/" target="_blank">Image Source</a></h6>
We need to continue to engage in conversation about issues that are still prevalent, for the sake that nothing changes if we don't talk about it. We cannot stop the stream of data that gets sent from one person to another, so how about we ensure that the historical data that's important to all of us (or should be) is sent to all the right people. We need to ensure our voices are heard with large companies that make the biggest bonus out of the sale of diamonds. We need to see that they care enough to make a difference in their own industry.
